## BEYONDINVENTORY

**Description:**  
BEYONDINVENTORY is an inventory-management app that helps users catalog, organize, and quickly locate their personal belongings. Users can create hierarchical locations (e.g., Home → Attic → Box A), add items with photos and metadata (name, description, tags, serial/SKU, value), and use search and filters to find items instantly. The app supports exporting inventories as CSV for backups or insurance, and is designed to be mobile-friendly so users can add photos while walking through their space.

**Key features:**
- Create and nest locations (rooms, boxes, containers)  
- Add items with photos, tags, and detailed metadata  
- Search and filter by name, tag, location, or keyword  
- Export/import CSV for backups or sharing  
- Optional multi-device sync and user accounts for cross-device use

**Technologies (example):** React, React Router, localStorage (MVP)
