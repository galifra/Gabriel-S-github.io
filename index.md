I am an aspiring web developer with skills in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React**.  
I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems and help people interact with technology in meaningful ways.  

My goal is to join a team where I can grow as a developer, contribute to exciting projects, and continue learning new technologies.
